<p>
In 1620, the first members of my American family arrived on New England
shores seeking a better life and free opportunities.  Over time, various
immigration standards, policies and laws have provided an inlet for future
generations to arrive.  John F. Kennedy wrote that "every American who
ever lived, with the exception of one group, was either an immigrant
himself or a descendant of immigrants." It is my strongest intent and
desire to assist today's families in attaining the American Dream.  The Law
Office of Ethan O. Beattie is dedicated to provide sound legal advice and
representation in the ever-growing and too often complex realm of
immigration law.  The door was open for my family; now let's see if,
together, we can open that door for yours.
